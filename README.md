It's a Flex based Professional CSS Framework that has been created after researching a lots of other Frameworks. Our Professional developers have added several classes according to our working environment. We have used many other CSS Libraries, but none provided the full layout covered classes. So we have generated our own Professional Framework with massive 48 columns partition. It has not been created in one day, it has taken about 200 to 300 days to full phase complete. So use rx CSS Framework and create blazingly fast websites without writing any extra CSS classes.
